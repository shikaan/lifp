BUGS
---
  * [ ] `listGet` allows you to go out of bound

FEATURES
---
  * [ ] Load a file in REPL and continue execution from there (debug mode)
  * [ ] imports `(import! my-module "./my-module.lifp")`
  * [ ] Decouple validation from execution
  * [ ] Enforce naming conventions for functions
    * [ ] effectful functions should terminate with !
    * [ ] functions ending in ? should return bool
  * [ ] Type Declaration comments `;; (number, number) -> number`
  * [ ] Compile AST to bytecode
  * [ ] Tail call optimization

REFACTORING
---
  * [ ] Make list methods (and hashmap methods) typesafe (now you can append
       `node_t` to a `value_list_t` without errors)
  * [ ] Use [`libuv`](https://libuv.org) for non-blocking io
  * [ ] Some structs are huge: mostly because we try to colocate most things.
        Do we need all of that?
        - The only place where we need flexible lists is the tokenizer and
          parser. From that point on all the lists have defined length and
          should be arrays.
        - Having colocation though helps with copying, listAppend and mapSet,
          since we don't have to follow pointers.
  * [ ] Related to the above, we probably want to reintroduce a lightweight
        approach to arena frames as currently workflows that use strings use an
        embarrassing amount of memory

OPEN STUFF
---
* Should std and core (e.g., keywords) be split to allow using lifp without std?
